# Time Lapse Generator

This is just a simple sync cut generator, which uses a FFT to determine drum beats, then cuts the video to it. It doesn't produce any output audio, but you can re-sync it after it runs. To use it, simply put in your files into the Source_Data folder and edit the prefrences file accordingly. The output file will be named 'output.mp4' unless you change the filename output in the main function.
